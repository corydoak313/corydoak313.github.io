  <h3> Code Review Video</h3>
  Here, I explain the code I will be making adjustments and enhancements to and how it will improve the overall functionality.

  <h3> Self Assessment </h3>
  As I progressed through the program, I was able to get experience in different languages including Java, Python, and C++. Throughout the program I got to see the beginning and end results of project and saw the lifecycle of the development. From formulating to SCRUM planning to actual development, I was able to work off a project and understand the goals and requirements of the clients' needs to create the final project. As I reflect on the program and contribute to this ePortfolio, I am able to see my progress through the courses, review my work and see where I have made improvement and where I seem to prosper. Being able to run tests and ensure the quality of the program is where I find my skillset as I read through the code and obtain the proper understanding of what it expected and then going through and test different portions of the code to ensure it all functions together. Skills I have obtained while working through the program include being able to communicate with team members and give updates on what progress has been made, touching base with the clients and ensuring they are getting what hey expect. In addition I also continue to develop code that is up to date with security protocols and verify the protection of data as well as comply with code standards to ensure integrity and authenticity.

  Working through the course, I showcase my skillsets by reworking through an old project. As I worked through this project, I was able to see that code was not finished, did not function properly, and lacked the detail to perform the necessary tasks. In some code, I was calling for the wrong variables and methods to perform functions, had an excessive amount of repeated code, and was not consistent in code style. By enhancing the chosen artifacts, I was able to improve the functionality of the files so they called upon each other correctly, used the correct variables, and rewrote the code so it flowed together in the tasks being performed. The project, Grand Strand Systems, was meant to run JUnit tests to ensure the program was running correctly. In the ContactService file, we were able to make changes to the Contact information such as first or last name, address, or phone number. The ContactServiceTest file was where we had implemented tests to make sure not onlt that the code was working correctly with inouts, but that it was also identifying when there was an issue. Together these worked together along with the Contact file that initiated the variables for the contact information.
